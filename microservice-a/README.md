# Steps to run the application:

1. Make sure you have Java installed. On Windows, Mac, or Linux, type this into the command line:
        java -version
2. If you don't have Java installed:
    - Windows does not provide a built-in command-line utility to download Java directly. However, you can download Java manually from the official Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and install it using the installer.
    - On Mac, you can install Java using Homebrew by running the following command:
        brew install openjdk
    - On Linux, you can install Java using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
3. Make sure you have Maven installed. On Windows, Mac, or Linux, type this into the command line:
        mvn -version
4. If you don't have Maven installed:
    - Windows does not provide a built-in command-line utility to download Maven directly. However, you can download Maven manually from the official Apache Maven website (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and install it using the installer.
    - On Mac, you can install Maven using Homebrew by running the following command:
        brew install maven
    - On Linux, you can install Maven using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run the following command:
        sudo apt-get install maven
5. Next, change directory to the project root directory
6. To build the project, type:
        mvn clean install
7. To run the project, type:
        mvn spring-boot:run
8. To test the project, open a web browser and navigate to:
    http://localhost:8080/api/convert/weight?value=100&fromUnit=pounds&toUnit=kilograms
